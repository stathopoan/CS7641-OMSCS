ASSIGNMENT 2

Description
------------
This code is for assignment 2 of machine learning course. It creates plots and results for the report.

Prerequisites
-------------
Please use Anaconda for easy creation of environment.

1. Navigate to the parent folder assignment2 and locate environment.yml 
2. Type: conda env create -f environment.yml

This will create the exact env required for the code to run. This code is based on common frameworks like sciki-learn, pandas and mlrose

Run the code
-------------
To run the code just navigate to the parent folder assignment2.

For the Neural Network part just run: run_NN_experiment.py script

For the 3 optimization problems just run: run_problems.py script



Directories
--------
All plots are saved in the plots folder in four folders: one for the NN experiment and 3 for the individual problems
The data files are located in the data folder.

Notes
------

The two scripts: run_NN_experiment.py and run_problems.py will call all routines necessary. Please note that it takes about 15 - 20 minutes to run the code.

The code was developed in Anaconda env on Windows 10 pro system wih

Anaconda v. 4.8.2
platform: win64
