CS7641 MACHINE LEARNING
ASSIGNMENT 1

Description
------------
This code is for assignment 1 of machine learning course. It creates plots and results for the report.

Get the code
------------

Fetch the code from my public github repo: https://github.com/stathopoan/CS7641-OMSCS.git

Prerequisites
-------------
Please use Anaconda for easy creation of environment.

1. Navigate to the folder assignment1 and locate environment.yml 
2. Type: conda env create -f environment.yml

This will create the exact env required for the code to run. This code is based on common frameworks like sciki-learn, pandas,... and is
not utilizing GPU acceleration.

Run the code
-------------
To run the code just navigate to the folder assignment1. Locate main.py and run it with 'python main.py'. That's it!

Directories
--------
All plots are saved in the assignment1\plots folder in two folders one for each dataset
The data files are located in the assignment1\data folder.

Notes
------

The assignment1\main.py script will call all routines necessary. Please note that it takes about 1/2 hour to run the code with 100% CPU utilization.
Training of algorithms is embedded in the code and is not parameterized to choose either test/train results.

The code was developed in Anaconda env on Windows 10 pro system wih

Anaconda v. 4.8.2
platform: win64
python   v. 3.7.6
